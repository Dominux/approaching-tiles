[Old DOM version](https://github.com/Dominux/approaching-tiles/tree/dom_version) - is not used anymore cause of a lot of flickering caused by unperformant way to render the playground. The code is still avalaible as a branch.

Now [canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas) and [requestAnimationFrame](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame) is used to be a rendering tools to improve perfomance by delegating render control to a browser.
